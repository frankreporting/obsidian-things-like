# The fire next time

zotero:: [🔗](zotero://select/items/@baldwin1993FireNext)

*A national bestseller when it first appeared in 1963, The Fire Next Time galvanized the nation, gave passionate voice to the emerging civil rights movement—and still lights the way to understanding race in America today. "Basically the finest essay I’ve ever read. . . . Baldwin refused to hold anyone’s hand. He was both direct and beautiful all at once. He did not seem to write to convince you. He wrote beyond you.” —Ta-Nehisi Coates*

# Notes:

But I had been in the pulpit too long and I had seen too many monstrous things. I don't refer merely to the glaring fact that the minister eventually acquires houses and Cadillacs while the faithful continue to scrub floors and drop their dimes and quarters and dollars into the plate. I really mean that there was no love in the church. It was a mask for hatred and self - hatred and despair. The transfiguring power of the Holy Ghost ended when the service ended, and salvation stopped at the church door. When we were told to love everybody, I had thought that that meant everybody. But no. It applied only to those who believed as we did, and it did not apply to white people at all. I was told by a minister, for example, that I should never, on any public conveyance, under any circumstances, rise and give my seat to a white woman. White men never rose for Negro women. Well, that was true enough, in the main — I saw his point. But what was the point, the purpose, of my salvation if it did not permit me to behave with love toward others, no matter how they behaved toward me?

In spite of everything, there was in the life I fled a zest and a joy and a capacity for facing and surviving disaster that are very moving and very rare. Perhaps we were, all of us — pimps, whores, racketeers, church members, and children — bound together by the nature of our oppression, the specific and peculiar complex of risks we had to run ; if so, within these limits we sometimes achieved with each other a freedom that was close to love. I remember, anyway, church suppers and outings, and, later, after I left the church, rent and waistline parties where rage and sorrow sat in the darkness and did not stir, and we ate and drank and talked and laughed and danced and forgot all about "the man." We had the liquor, the chicken, the music, and each other, and had no need to pretend to be what we were not. This is the freedom that one hears in some gospel songs, for example, and in jazz. In all jazz, and especially in the blues, there is something tart and ironic, authoritative and double - edged.

Location 350
White Americans seem to feel that happy songs are happy and sad songs are sad, and that, God help us, is exactly the way most white Americans sing them — sounding, in both cases, so helplessly, defenselessly fatuous that one dare not speculate on the temperature of the deep freeze from which issue their brave and sexless little voices.

Location 361
To be sensual, I think, is to respect and rejoice in the force of life, of life itself, and to be present in all that one does, from the effort of loving to the breaking of bread.

Location 363
Something very sinister happens to the people of a country when they begin to distrust their own reactions as deeply as they do here, and become as joyless as they have become. It is this individual uncertainty on the part of white American men and women, this inability to renew themselves at the fountain of their own lives, that makes the discussion, let alone elucidation, of any conundrum — that is, any reality — so supremely difficult. The person who distrusts himself has no touchstone for reality — for this touchstone can be only oneself. Such a person interposes between himself and reality nothing less than a labyrinth of attitudes. And these attitudes, furthermore, though the person is usually unaware of it (is unaware of so much!), are historical and public attitudes. They do not relate to the present any more than they relate to the person. Therefore, whatever white people do not know about Negroes reveals, precisely and inexorably, what they do not know about themselves.

This is the crux of what baldwin and Coates argue about white privileged innocence and ignorance. I need to reflect on it more bc i dont quite get the logic

They have forgotten that the religion that is now identified with their virtue and their power — "God is on our side," says Dr. Verwoerd — came out of a rocky piece of ground in what is now known as the Middle East before color was invented, and that in order for the Christian church to be established, Christ had to be put to death, by Rome, and that the real architect of the Christian church was not the disreputable, sunbaked Hebrew who gave it his name but the mercilessly fanatical and self - righteous St. Paul. The energy that was buried with the rise of the Christian nations must come back into the world ; nothing can prevent it. Many of us, I think, both long to see this happen and are terrified of it, for though this transformation contains the hope of liberation, it also imposes a necessity for great change. But in order to deal with the untapped and dormant force of the previously subjugated, in order to survive as a human, moving, moral weight in the world, America and all the Western nations will be forced to reëxamine themselves and release themselves from many things that are now taken to be sacred, and to discard nearly all the assumptions that have been used to justify their lives and their anguish and their crimes so long.

A reckoning needed. Also good note for Threat and Yusha

"The white man's Heaven, "sings a Black Muslim minister," is the black man's Hell." One may object — possibly — that this puts the matter somewhat too simply, but the song is true, and it has been true for as long as white men have ruled the world. The Africans put it another way: When the white man came to Africa, the white man had the Bible and the African had the land, but now it is the white man who is being, reluctantly and bloodily, separated from the land, and the African who is still attempting to digest or to vomit up the Bible. The struggle, therefore, that now begins in the world is extremely complex, involving the historical role of Christianity in the realm of power — that is, politics — and in the realm of morals.

And I dismissed the Nation of Islam's demand for a separate black economy in America, which I had also heard before, as willful, and even mischievous, nonsense. Then two things caused me to begin to listen to the speeches, and one was the behavior of the police.

Beautiful description, and such self awareness. Makes me aware in a way how little self awareness i bring to my own journalism, and i wonder if most journalism isnt performative in a sense. Gather facts, assemble them in some logical order, plug into some well rehearsed formula. But how much do you really understand, how much did you learn?

No peope can believe themselves superior (morally, genetically, whatever) without making it equally plausible tha some other people has rights to that claim

"I love a few people and they love me and some of them are white, and isn't love more important than color?"

Note - Location 759
Beware how we treat each other with language for it is either a sign of how bad things have become or a portent of things to come. To call a man legally 3/5 of a man is to invite his mistreatment. To deny marriage is to deny what two men feel for each other could be love. And if they cannot love then what are they worth in our eyes?

Note - Location 787
Puts in mind parodies of white people as oblivious smiling zombies like that music video of all the white people dancing in the street after a cop shoots a kid. The white picket fences etc. Black people are only now getting power in media and the art they make reflects us back to ourselves in a way we have never experienced because we were always before in control of the pictures and narratives. The whole country perhaps needs the kind of mean slapstick comedy, equivalent to black face, that we used too level at them, but this time leveled at us. Maybe when that is out of our system we can begin to see and accept each other.

Location 158
Do we white people lack self love? Maybe. I certainly struggled with self esteem all my life. The put downs, the teasing, the lack of basic respect for another person. But how do you measure a culture, or its effects on people? 

> Neither civilized reason nor Christian love would cause any of those people to treat you as they presumably wanted to be treated ; only the fear of your power to retaliate would cause them to do that, or to seem to do it, which was (and is) good enough. There appears to be a vast amount of confusion on this point, but I do not know many Negroes who are eager to be "accepted" by white people, still less to be loved by them ; they, the blacks, simply don't wish to be beaten over the head by the whites every instant of our brief passage on this planet. White people in this country will have quite enough to do in learning how to accept and love themselves and each other, and when they have achieved this — which will not be tomorrow and may very well be never — the Negro problem will no longer exist, for it will no longer be needed.

# Black People Do Not Need White Acceptance

I have been raised with a superiority complex, but the indoctrination must have been subtle. I do not remember it. However it happened, it's now true that I do not _feel_ Black people, Brown people, poor people, uneducated people, as individuals who have risen to this society's standard of excellence. I have been drilled to pursue excellence myself, and yet if I should fall short, I have always known that I was never going to end up like those poor inner-city folks. But fancy that: even among the poorest, there is a sense of style and pride and self-worth that comes from somewhere deep within and from the knowledge of belonging. There is a more visceral understanding of life and worth in those who have struggled and suffered, and so while we strive for acceptance from other white folks based on our social status, our jobs, our net worth, we are starved for a more basic acceptance from those who _really_ know what it means to be human.

> There is no reason for you to try to become like white people and there is no basis whatever for their impertinent assumption that they must accept you. The really terrible thing, old buddy, is that you must accept them. And I mean that very seriously. You must accept them and accept them with love. For these innocent people have no other hope. They are, in effect, still trapped in a history which they do not understand; and until they understand it, they cannot be released from it. They have had to believe for many years, and for innumerable reasons, that black men are inferior to white men. Many of them, indeed, know better, but, as you will discover, people find it very difficult to act on what they know. To act is to be committed, and to be committed is to be in danger. In this case, the danger, in the minds of most white Americans, is the loss of their identity. [Location 76][@Baldwin1993FNT]

# No Forgiveness for White Supremacy and America's Racist History

> And I know, which is much worse, and this is the crime of which I accuse my country and my countrymen, and for which neither I nor time nor history will ever forgive them, that they have destroyed and are destroying hundreds of thousands of lives and do not know it and do not want to know it. [Location 47][@Baldwin1993FNT]

...

> But it is not permissible that the authors of devastation should also be innocent. It is the innocence which constitutes the crime. [Location 51][@Baldwin1993FNT]

# Black Freedom Depends on White Freedom but whites are not free

It could take another hundred years to achieve real equality, equity, freedom for all disadvantaged, downtrodden, oppressed groups. I think that may be on the optimistic side. Baldwin left the country, after all, just like W.E.B. DuBois, and just like Nina Simone. Baldwin's sentiment seemed to be that integration would allow Black people to force white people to see the situation with clear eyes — and themselves, for what they are. But instead we get white flight. Running, hiding, avoiding. And like a pile of dishes in the sink or a phone call you've been putting off for much too long, it only grows the more intimidating, more painful, the longer you procrastinate. The work only grows harder.

> But these men are your brothers — your lost, younger brothers. And if the word integration means anything, this is what it means: that we, with love, shall force our brothers to see themselves as they are, to cease fleeing from reality and begin to change it. [Location 88][@Baldwin1993FNT]

> You know, and I know, that the country is celebrating one hundred years of freedom one hundred years too soon. We cannot be free until they are free. [Location 94][@Baldwin1993FNT]

> But the Negro's experience of the white world cannot possibly create in him any respect for the standards by which the white world claims to live. His own condition is overwhelming proof that white people do not live by these standards. Negro servants have been smuggling odds and ends out of white homes for generations, and white people have been delighted to have them do it, because it has assuaged a dim guilt and testified to the intrinsic superiority of white people. Even the most doltish and servile Negro could scarcely fail to be impressed by the disparity between his situation and that of the people for whom he worked ; Negroes who were neither doltish nor servile did not feel that they were doing anything wrong when they robbed white people.

In spite of the Puritan - Yankee equation of virtue with well - being, Negroes had excellent reasons for doubting that money was made or kept by any very striking adherence to the Christian virtues ; it certainly did not work that way for black Christians. In any case, white people, who had robbed black people of their liberty and who profited by this theft every hour that they lived, had no moral ground on which to stand. They had the judges, the juries, the shotguns, the law — in a word, power. But it was a criminal power, to be feared but not respected, and to be outwitted in any way whatever. And those virtues preached but not practiced by the white world were merely another means of holding Negroes in subjection. [Location 170][@Baldwin1993FNT]

> Every effort made by the child's elders to prepare him for a fate from which they cannot protect him causes him secretly, in terror, to begin to await, without knowing that he is doing so, his mysterious and inexorable punishment. He must be "good" not only in order to please his parents and not only to avoid being punished by them ; behind their authority stands another, nameless and impersonal, infinitely harder to please, and bottomlessly cruel.

> To defend oneself against a fear is simply to insure that one will, one day, be conquered by it; fears must be faced. As for one's wits, it is just not true that one can live by them — not, that is, if one wishes really to live. [Location 213][@Baldwin1993FNT]

> That summer, in any case, all the fears with which I had grown up, and which were now a part of me and controlled my vision of the world, rose up like a wall between the world and me, and drove me into the church. [Location 215][@Baldwin1993FNT]

> Yes, it does indeed mean something — something unspeakable — to be born, in a white country, an Anglo-Teutonic, antisexual country, black. You very soon, without knowing it, give up all hope of communion. Black people, mainly, look down or look up but do not look at each other, not at you, and white people, mainly, look away.

> The universe, which is not merely the stars and the moon and the planets, flowers, grass, and trees, but other people, has evolved no terms for your existence, has made no room for you, and if love will not swing wide the gates, no other power will or can. And if one despairs — as who has not? — of human love, God's love alone is left. But God — and I felt this even then, so long ago, on that tremendous floor, unwillingly — is white. And if His love was so great, and if He loved all His children, why were we, the blacks, cast down so far? Why? [Location 243][@Baldwin1993FNT]

# Baldwin Fire Next Time Location 252

> And by the time I was able to ask myself this question, I was also able to see that the principles governing the rites and customs of the churches in which I grew up did not differ from the principles governing the rites and customs of other churches, white. The principles were Blindness, Loneliness, and Terror, the first principle necessarily and actively cultivated in order to deny the two others. I would love to believe that the principles were Faith, Hope, and Charity, but this is clearly not so for most Christians, or for what we call the Christian world. [Location 252][@Baldwin1993FNT]

> These men had all been operating under divine inspiration. Had they? All of them? And I also knew by now, alas, far more about divine inspiration than I dared admit, for I knew how I worked myself up into my own visions, and how frequently — indeed, incessantly — the visions God granted to me differed from the visions He granted to my father.

> My best friend in high school was a Jew. He came to our house once, and afterward my father asked, as he asked about everyone, "Is he a Christian?" — by which he meant "Is he saved?" I really do not know whether my answer came out of innocence or venom, but I said coldly, "No. He's Jewish." My father slammed me across the face with his great palm, and in that moment everything flooded back — all the hatred and all the fear, and the depth of a merciless resolve to kill my father rather than allow my father to kill me — and I knew that all those sermons and tears and all that repentance and rejoicing had changed nothing. I wondered if I was expected to be glad that a friend of mine, or anyone, was to be tormented forever in Hell, and I also thought, suddenly, of the Jews in another Christian nation, Germany. They were not so far from the fiery furnace after all, and my best friend might have been one of them. I told my father, "He's a better Christian than you are," and walked out of the house.
