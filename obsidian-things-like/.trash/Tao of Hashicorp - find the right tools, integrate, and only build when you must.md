The idea is that you use the right tools for each job, make sure they're tightly integrated, and build your own tools when needed... this might suggest having our own custom story planning app at [[SCPR]] isn't necessarily better than using [[Airtable]] and linking it to other tools. We'd have to look at the whole picture, costs and benefits, etc.

Shared the concept/page with [[@Vijay Singh]] on [[2021-07-29]] and he said: "I like this - I think it's a strong philosophy."

Emailed [[@Andy Cheatwood]] but didn't really get a response.
